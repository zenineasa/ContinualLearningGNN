# Solving Partial Differential Equations using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks with Continual Learning
 Continual Learning, represents the idea of learning continuously about the external world in order to enable the autonomous, incremental development of ever more complex skills and knowledge in current intelligent system. In this project, we explore the possibility of continual learning under the combination of graphic deep learning message passing and partial differentiation equations; to achieve a solver that learns to solve using data generated by classical solvers and then generalize it, with the extended ability to be retrained without forgetting what it had learnt in the past.
